# ResearchIT5016D
While doing assignment for research repository & software development project I learned and still learning different python functions and data types etc.
few of the codes i practised have been uploaded here in my reseach repository with the name given to the file similar to what is inside. like file name string is just my code to learn what is string. 

Below two programs i find very interesting:-
I practised game rock paper & scissor under file name game.
Ceaser cipher encrption decryption program

I liked how we can use python in a railway ticket or movie booking ticket system. I practised some of it too.

Few of the codes which were practiced and written by me while working towards project are still not working but uploaded here with the file name-code not working.
