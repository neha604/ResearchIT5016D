# To calculate the gravitational force between earth & venus

G=6.67e-11  # gravitational constant

mass_1=6e24 # in kg (mass of earth)
mass_2=4.9e24  # in kg (mass of venus)
distance=4.1e10  # in m (distance between Earth and Venus)

  # <--- replace with your code

force= (G * mass_1 * mass_2) / (distance **2)

print(force)
